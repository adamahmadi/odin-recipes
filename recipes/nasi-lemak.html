        <h2>Dish Description</h2>

        <p><em>Nasi lemak</em> is a rice dish commonly served with roasted nuts, egg, <em>ikan bilis</em> (anchovies), and slices of cucumber. Literally meaning “<em>fatty rice</em>” in Malay, nasi lemak’s distinctive 
            taste comes from cooking the rice in coconut milk and pandan leaves which gives the dish its rich flavour and fragrant aroma. It is rounded off with spicy sambal – a chilli paste 
            made from dried chilies, garlic, shallots, and belacan (shrimp paste).</p>
        
        <p>Nasi lemak has roots in Malay cuisine. It is believed to have originated from the indigenous community who lived by the sea on the West coast of Malaysia in the 19th century, where coconuts and anchovies 
            were widely accessible. The dish later became a staple diet for farmers who worked in the rice fields. In the 1970s, nasi lemak was sold in packets by hawkers travelling from house to house.</p>
