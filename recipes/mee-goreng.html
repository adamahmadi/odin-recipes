        <h2>Dish Description</h2>

        <p>This one originates from Indonesia – called <em>Mie Goreng</em> or <em>Mee Goreng</em>. It’s also pretty common in Malaysia though you’ll find the Malaysian version often has a hint of curry powder added.</p>
        
        <p>The unique thing about Mie Goreng is the sweet sticky sauce, and that there’s a good variety of “stuff” in the noodles. Though there’s no exact rules about what goes in it, the combination I’ve used in this 
            recipe is pretty common – chicken, prawns, cabbage, bean sprouts, green onion and the signature “egg ribbons” which is simply a thin egg omelette rolled up and sliced into strips (it seriously takes less than 2 minutes to make).</p>
